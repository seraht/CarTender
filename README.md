<h1>In this project we wanted to evaluate the parameters that can affect the sale price of a car in a tender </h1>

<h4>We need to make a distinction between two types of parameters:</h4>

<b>1) Parameters that are not in control:</b>
- km
- dateroad year
- brand
...

<b>2) Parameters that we have control</b>
- Number of people that participate to the tender
- Number of cars in a tender
- Number of cars with the same km in the tender
...

Our goal is to increase income by slightly modifying the organization of the tenders.
